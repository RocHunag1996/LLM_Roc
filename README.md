# Large Model Notes and Code

Welcome to my repository on **Large Models**! This repository contains my notes, code, and resources related to large machine learning models, such as **GPT**, **BERT**, and other **transformer-based architectures**. It includes both theoretical concepts and practical code implementations aimed at building and fine-tuning these models.

## Introduction to Large Models

Large models, such as **GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and **T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). These models are pre-trained on massive datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.

### Key Features of Large Models:
- **Pre-training on vast datasets**: Large models are trained on diverse text corpora, which makes them capable of understanding a wide variety of contexts.
- **Transfer learning**: Once pre-trained, these models can be fine-tuned with task-specific data to perform specialized tasks effectively.
- **State-of-the-art performance**: Models like GPT-3 and BERT achieve state-of-the-art performance in many NLP benchmarks and applications.

In this repository, you'll find resources to help you understand how these models work, how to train and fine-tune them, and how to use them for real-world applications.
